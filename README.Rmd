The goal of urbioconnect is to demonstrate a workflow of connectivity analysis for the superb fairy wren. The code has been lightly adapted from [urbanConnect](https://github.com/urbio-ecology/urbanConnect), with the overall method being developed by Holly Kirk et al., in ["Ecological connectivity as a planning tool for the conservation of wildlife in cities"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016122003636?via%3Dihub).

# Usage

Currently we have focussed our efforts on developing methods to be used in pipelines and in a shiny app. We will provide walkthroughs of using the pipeline and the package soon, but for the time being, here are some simple directions on how to run the shiny app:

1. Install the package:

```r
install.packages('urbioconnect', repos = c('https://urbio-ecology.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

(or if that doesn't work, try using `{remotes}`)

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("urbio-ecology/urbioconnect")
```

2. Load the package:

```r
library(urbioconnect)
```

3. Launch the app:

```r
run_connectivity_app()
```

You can see the shiny app in action at: https://njtierney.shinyapps.io/urbioconnect/

## Example usage

There are many functions in `urbioconnect` that power the shiny app, which you
can use in your own work. As the package is still under construction, we are
still fine-tuning things. Stay tuned!
