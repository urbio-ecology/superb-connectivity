The goal of superb-connectivity is to demonstrate a workflow of connectivity analysis for the superb fairy wren. The code has been lightly adapted from [urbanConnect](https://github.com/urbio-ecology/urbanConnect), with the overall method being developed by Holly Kirk et al., in ["Ecological connectivity as a planning tool for the conservation of wildlife in cities"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016122003636?via%3Dihub).
