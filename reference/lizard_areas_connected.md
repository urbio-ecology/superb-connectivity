# Connected habitat patch areas for Blue-tongued Lizard

Pre-computed per-patch areas for the lizard example data at a 50 metre
interpatch distance. This is a `patch_size_tbl` – the per-patch table
carried inside the `connectivity` object returned by
[`habitat_connectivity()`](https://urbio-ecology.github.io/urbioconnect/reference/habitat_connectivity.md),
extracted with the
[`patch_sizes()`](https://urbio-ecology.github.io/urbioconnect/reference/patch_sizes.md)
accessor. Contains one row per connected habitat patch.

## Usage

``` r
lizard_areas_connected
```

## Format

A `patch_size_tbl` with columns:

- patch_id:

  Integer. Connected fragment ID.

- area:

  Numeric. Total area of the connected patch in square metres.
