\title{Calculate habitat connectivity}
\usage{
habitat_connectivity(habitat, barrier, distance)
}
\arguments{
\item{habitat}{SF object. Original habitat spatial data.}

\item{barrier}{SF object. Barrier spatial data (e.g., roads, waterways).}

\item{distance}{Numeric. Threshold distance in meters for connectivity.
Habitat patches within this distance are considered connected.}
}
\value{
Data frame with connectivity metrics for each connected patch,
including \code{patch_id}, \code{area_total}, and \code{area_squared}.
}
\description{
Performs complete habitat connectivity analysis using vector-based spatial
operations. Buffers habitat, fragments it along barriers, and calculates
areas of connected patches.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load habitat and barrier data
habitat <- sf::st_read("habitat.shp")
roads <- sf::st_read("roads.shp")

# Calculate connectivity at 100m threshold
connectivity <- habitat_connectivity(habitat, roads, distance = 100)
}
