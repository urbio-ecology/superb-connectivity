\description{
Many shape files contain errors, places where the edges of a polygon cross
over or polygons which overlap. This helps remove some of those errors by
smoothing the edges of polygons, removing corners, and dissolving edges
where polygons overlap. This reduces the complexity of the shape file,
making future steps faster.
