\title{Calculate effective mesh size}
\usage{
effective_mesh_size(area_squared, area_total)
}
\arguments{
\item{area_squared}{Numeric vector. Squared areas of connected patches.}

\item{area_total}{Numeric vector. Total areas of connected patches.}

\value{
Numeric. Effective mesh size in hectares.
}
\description{
Computes the effective mesh size metric for habitat connectivity, which
represents the probability that two randomly chosen points within habitat
remain connected.
